A. I added 1 column Duration(h)
I've put the data.
Then I added next column Duration (sec).
The program added 1 column, but in the same time all data from Duration(h) were lost. Whole column became empty.

So I've input one more time all data to the 2 empty columns and I saved the file by File -> Save.
Then I selected last row, on the bottom of table, and I've added a row through Edit-> Insert, I've input all data. When I have pressed the "Apply" button - I lost one more time the data from 2 newly added columns - it becomes empty. 
Fortunately I've opened one more time the file from the disc and the data were there.

With the file 0087_time_collisions.csv the drawing based on duration in seconds doesn't work. Minutes are ok, hours - ok, except bar for last row (it starts at 16:30 and on the chart at 16:00). So - please see this 2 issues:
- drawing for last record which has to start at 16:30. there is a problem while the duration is in hours not in minutes
- conversion of seconds

Drawing works well when the duration is in minutes, for other types of duration ( day, hours ) the max range of the chart is not shown.

Collisions reports have bad info, when the duration is different than minutes. The program treat days or hours as minutes.
Collisions report gives wrong data. For example for the file 0087_timerversed2.csv, when X is "Day Start" and duration "Day duration"  "Person C" is in collision with A & B, and this is not reported.
Second thing - the report doesn't take into consideration collission in vertical, that means 1 specific person is in 2 or more differents rooms in the same moment of time. Only takes the collisions in horisontal, that means 2 persons are in the same room in at specific moment.
